| **Simple**               | Java is designed to be easy to use and accessible to programmers.                                                     |
| **Object-Oriented**      | Java is based on the concept of manipulating objects, promoting code reuse and modularity.                            |
| **Distributed**          | Java has built-in support for networked/distributed computing, allowing programs to easily operate across networks.   |
| **Multithreaded**        | Java supports multiple threads of execution, enabling concurrent processing and more efficient use of CPU resources.  |
| **Interpreted**          | Java code is converted to bytecode, which is then interpreted by the JVM, making it platform-independent.             |
| **Robust**               | Java emphasizes reliability, incorporating features like automatic memory management and exception handling.          |
| **Secure**               | Java is designed with a range of built-in security features including the sandbox environment to restrict code.       |
| **Architecture-Neutral** | Java code can be executed on any platform without modification, thanks to the JVM.                                    |
| **Portable**             | Java code can run on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable.                    |
| **High-Performance**     | While being an interpreted language, Java performance is enhanced by JIT compilation.                                 |
| **Dynamic**              | Java is designed to adapt to an evolving environment, with features that facilitate dynamic code loading and linking. |
