# Java History

- 1991 => James Gosling , Sun Microsystem inc.<br>
- "Oak" => "Java" 1995 <br>
- (1994) used for World Wide Web applications (since byte code can be
  downloaded and run without compiling it) <br>
- Eventually used as a general-purpose programming language (for the same
  reason as above plus it is object-oriented) <br>
- Now Owns by Oracle<br>
- Full-fledged application programming language<br>

## Full-Fledged Application Programming Language

The term "full-fledged application programming language" refers to a programming language that is equipped with a comprehensive set of features enabling developers to build a wide variety of applications, from simple scripts to complex, multi-functional software systems.

### Key Attributes

- **General-purpose**: These languages are designed to be applicable across a variety of application domains, rather than being specialized for specific tasks (e.g., just web programming or just system scripting).

- **Rich set of features**: They offer a broad array of built-in functionalities and constructs, such as data types, control structures, standard libraries, and APIs, which facilitate the development of software.

- **Support for different programming paradigms**: Many full-fledged languages support multiple programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and sometimes functional programming, giving developers the flexibility to choose the best approach for their project.

- **Extensive library support**: They typically come with extensive standard libraries and frameworks that simplify tasks like GUI development, network programming, handling multimedia, performing scientific calculations, and more.

- **Tools and IDEs**: There is robust support in the form of development tools, including compilers, interpreters, debuggers, and integrated development environments (IDEs), which help streamline the coding, testing, and deployment processes.

- **Community and documentation**: A full-fledged language usually has a strong community and comprehensive documentation, which are crucial for developer support and continuous learning.

### Examples of Full-Fledged Application Programming Languages

- **Java**: Known for its portability across platforms (thanks to the JVM - Java Virtual Machine), extensive libraries, and widespread use in enterprise environments.

- **Python**: Popular for its readability, simplicity, and the vast array of libraries that make it suitable for everything from web development to data science.

- **C#**: Developed by Microsoft, this language is integral to the .NET framework and is commonly used for both desktop and web applications.

- **C++**: An extension of C that includes object-oriented features, widely used in software that requires high performance, like gaming engines and real-time systems.

- **JavaScript**: Essential for web development, supported by a massive number of frameworks and libraries that extend its capabilities beyond browser-based scripts to full-scale server-side applications.

These languages allow developers to tackle various software development challenges efficiently, making them suitable for a broad range of programming needs.

## Not Radical or Especially New

When describing something as **"not radical or especially new,"** we are referring to ideas, methods, or products that are conservative or traditional. This term implies adherence to established norms or practices rather than introducing significant innovations or changes.

### Contextual Applications

- **Technology**: In this realm, the term could refer to software updates that focus on minor improvements or bug fixes rather than incorporating cutting-edge features that might overhaul the system.

- **Fashion**: Here, it might describe a collection that remains faithful to classic styles instead of adopting avant-garde trends that mark a radical departure from the norm.

- **Politics**: In a political context, it could characterize policies that aim to maintain the status quo rather than proposing drastic reforms or revolutionary changes.

### Significance

This phrase highlights a preference for stability and continuity, suggesting a possibly lower-risk and more predictable approach in various fields.

- Adopts its looks from C++, and its behavior from Smalltalk<br>
- Compiled to processor-neutral instruction set then
  interpreted on each supporting platform <br>
- Extremely fast adoption rate! (due to WWW)<br>
